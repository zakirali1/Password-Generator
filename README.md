# Password-Generator

This program is designed to take user input and generate a password based on user selection. The end user is advised to offer a maximum value for the length the password needs to be. It then generates a series of pop-ups asking the end-user to select character types they would like to include in their new password. These can either be one or all of the following: lowercase/uppercase characters, numerics or special characters, but at least 1 character type will need to be selected otherwise they the page will be reloaded and end-user will be back to the first prompt. After selecting the options that apply, the generate button will create a new password.
